# Movie Trailer Website Project

This is a python generated website featuring some of my **FAVE** movies past, present and future.

** Interested in making one for yourself. Keep reading.

## Requirements

<ul>
    <li>Install <a href="www.python.com">Python</a> </li>
</ul>

## Directions

<ol>
    <li> Open <a href="www.python.com">Python</a> and create a file called `media.py`. You will create a `class Movie()` which will list all of the movie date that you need for this program to work.</li>
    <li>Fork this <a href="https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode"> Repository</a> and download starter files. </li>
    <li> Open starter file:
            <ul>
              <li> `fresh_tomatoes.py` </li>
            </ul>
    <li> Open new file in Python & create data structure to store **FAVE** movie info (i.e. movie title, box art URL and Youtube video). Save file as `entertainment_center.py`</li>
    <li> Create multiple instances of that Python Class within `entertainment_center.py` file.</li>
    <li> Be sure to correctly import correctly within each file to ensure that your website renders correctly.</li>
</ol>
